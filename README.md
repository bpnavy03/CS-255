# The DriverPass project is aimed to help prepare individuals for taking their driving tests at their local DMV.
# The client is Liam, who wants us to design a website, which is also available on mobile devices, that allows individuals to access the resources required for them to pass their driving test.

# I believe that my diagrams got better as the course went on. I do not have significant experience in this area, but I learned significantly as the course progressed.
# I also believe that my analysis of systems got significantly better as the course went on as well.
# Lastly, I believe I did well when discussing how to have technical discussions with a non-technical audience. I have done this throughout my Naval career, so I feel very comfortable with this concept.
#
# If I revised part of my work, it would be my initial project. There were a lot of places where I could have improved the clarity of my ideas. I would also rework my initial diagrams to make them better.
# In order to interpret the user's needs, I took notes on the interview and other source documentation. I would frequently revisit my notes and the source documents to ensure I was capturing exactly what
# the client invisioned. It is important when designing a system to consider the user's needs because that is the point of you working for them. They are using you to create their vision. You need to be able
# to capture their desires to give them the product they want.
#
# My approach to designing software is different than anything I have encountered in any course so far. As a simulation software engineer at a Nuclear plant, my designs are based strictly on the reference
# plants schematics and diagrams. While I get some liberties when making the systems perform the functions that they do in the actual plant, their aren't many liberities with programming that I get to take.
# Since my primary programming language is FORTRAN, coupled with strict federal regulations regarding nuclear simulator fidelity, many of these techniques don't present themselves to me on a routine basis.
# Possible in the future, if we upgrade our system, I will be able to use these ideoligies and concepts to help create a good, modern nuclear model.
